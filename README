Ideas to implement

[x] Show the lines of code for one commit 
[x] Show lines of unit tests
[x] Show lines of functional tests
[x] Show lines of integration tests
[x] Build graph for the last 5 commits hardcoded
[x] Build graph for the whole repo
[x] Reset the repo so it will work multiple times
[] Configure how long the graph is shown for
[] Bubble chart showing size of commits
[] Configure so the repo to checkout can be changed
[] Put in underscore.js
[] Show the dates of the commits along the x axis
[] Put the legend somewhere less obtrusive
[] Check out the code from the repo initially instead of assuming it's in /tmp/core
[] Store the line counts for hashes when they've calculated so they don't have to be re-calculated each time
[] Show the commits and their message on the graph
