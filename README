Ideas to implement

[x] Show the lines of code for one commit 
[x] Show lines of unit tests
[x] Show lines of functional tests
[x] Show lines of integration tests
[x] Build graph for the last 5 commits hardcoded
[x] Build graph for the whole repo
[x] Reset the repo so it will work multiple times
[x] Store commit line counts in a map so we don't have to recalculate each time
[x] Store commit line counts permanently somewhere
[x] Check out the code from the repo initially instead of assuming it's in /tmp/core
[x] Store the line counts for hashes when they've calculated so they don't have to be re-calculated each time
[x] Show ratio of test to code on graph
[x] Get mongo to load all the hashes instead of one at a time
[x] Show the dates of the commits along the x axis
[x] Put in underscore.js
[x] Put the legend somewhere less obtrusive
[x] How to configure the repo that we get stats for
[x] Try git reset HEAD before starting so commits don't get skipped
[x] Return uday.txt from a call to a local url
[x] Download the csv from go server
[x] Parse csv and send data as JSON to browser
[x] Create graph with data from csv
[x] Stop gitRepository variable being used absolutely everywhere - want to make it a timestamp directory
[] How do you override the === / deep equals so I can test my objects while still using the framework?
[] People you paired with since the last time you paired with 'x'
[] Show the people who have paired at some stage
[] Show the most popular pairs
[] Aliases for names when people check in with different names
[] Trend line on the graph
[] Show iteration by iteration stats in numbers rather than graphs
[] Pull out some of the code into own modules
[] Stats for more than one repo
[] Show the commits and their message on the graph
[] Ability to update mongo to add new metrics instead of tearing down each time 
[] Look at why mongo hangs
[] Look at the Mongo DNS error if it happens again
[] Add code coverage for each hash
[] Configure how long the graph is shown for
[] Bubble chart showing size of commits
[] Store the repository that the stats belong to
[] Introduce the Step library and get it working on lines of code stuff
[] Configure it to be able to ignore certain directories
[] Configure to be able to do different languages
[] Show the graph for individual files as well as for the whole code base
[] Make it possible to search for the files that can be graphed
