Ideas to implement

[x] Show the lines of code for one commit 
[x] Show lines of unit tests
[x] Show lines of functional tests
[x] Show lines of integration tests
[x] Build graph for the last 5 commits hardcoded
[x] Build graph for the whole repo
[x] Reset the repo so it will work multiple times
[x] Store commit line counts in a map so we don't have to recalculate each time
[x] Store commit line counts permanently somewhere
[x] Check out the code from the repo initially instead of assuming it's in /tmp/core
[x] Store the line counts for hashes when they've calculated so they don't have to be re-calculated each time
[] Show ratio of test to code on graph
[] Look at why mongo hangs
[] Get mongo to load all the hashes instead of one at a time
[] Look at the Mongo DNS error if it happens again
[] Add code coverage for each hash
[] Configure how long the graph is shown for
[] Bubble chart showing size of commits
[] Configure so the repo to checkout can be changed
[] Put in underscore.js
[] Show the dates of the commits along the x axis
[] Put the legend somewhere less obtrusive
[] Store the repository that the stats belong to
[] Show the commits and their message on the graph
[] Introduce the Step library and get it working on lines of code stuff
[] Configure it to be able to ignore certain directories
[] Configure to be able to do different languages
[] Show the graph for individual files as well as for the whole code base
[] Make it possible to search for the files that can be graphed
